## 🔴 CRITICAL

> No open items.

---

## 🟠 HIGH

> No open items.

### [ ] H8 — CLI client as fourth headless command-bus client — 🟠
- **Location:** new crate `crates/datacraft-cli` (bin `datacraft-cli`), step 9.4
- **Scope:** Fourth client of the command bus (besides GUI, MCP/JSON-RPC server, test harness): args → `Command` variants → `dispatch()` → human-readable or `--json` output of events and `inspect()` snapshots. No logic — transport only; shares the transport layer with the Phase 9.1 MCP server. Exit codes meaningful and deterministic output for headless tests.
- **Acceptance:** Every command-bus operation reachable from the shell; round-trip tests assert JSON snapshots; crate rules respected (ui/cli never touch storage directly).

### [ ] H9 — Jet4 writer workstream (create tables, write rows) — 🟠
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/src/jet/` (writer), post-Phase-4 workstream
- **Scope:** Jet4 write milestone from ARCHITECTURE §6 (create tables, insert/update rows, usage-map allocation, index maintenance deferred). UI write commands route to `InMemoryEngine` until this lands; then the `Jet4Backend` gains write capability. Bit-for-bit goal: writes must open without repair prompts in MS Access — proven by golden round-trips + oracle.
- **Acceptance:** Access opens written files without repair; decode(encode(decode(x))) == decode(x) over fixtures; write-path coverage >= gate.

### [ ] H21 — Compose the real Jet4Port in the UI binary (composition root) — 🟠
- **Location:** `crates/datacraft-ui/src/main.rs` (composition root), `app.rs` (App::new signature)
- **Problem:** The UI shell still composes `MockPort` (App::new constructs it internally), so File > Open Database "opens" an in-memory mock instead of a real .mdb file. The Jet4Port adapter exists (H16) but is unreachable from the binary.
- **Scope:** App::new takes `Box<dyn StoragePort>`; the binary's main() (composition root) constructs `Jet4Port::new()` and injects it — the ui crate itself keeps depending on core only (layering rule ui -> core); the bin target is the one place allowed to name storage. Land with step 6.2 (datasheet needs real rows anyway); until then the mock stays the documented Phase 5 backend.
- **Acceptance:** Opening the committed fixture through the UI shows its user tables in the navigation pane; the crate-level dependency graph stays ui -> core; canonical verification set green.

## 🟡 MEDIUM

> No open items.

## 🟢 LOW

> No open items.

### [ ] L1 — Jet 3 (Access 97) read support — 🟢
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/src/jet/`
- **Scope:** Jet 3 (Access 97) read support: 2048-byte pages, codepage-based text (no UTF-16), Jet3 TDEF layout. Deferred per default decision 2026-10-31 — Jet4 and ACE read paths come first; Jet3 files are detected via the version dword and rejected with a precise `Unsupported` error until this item lands.
- **Acceptance:** A Jet3 fixture decodes to schema + rows through the same `StorageEngine` boundary.

### [ ] L2 — Jet4 column type 0x11 (MSysAccessObjects.Data) — study and decide mapping — 🟢
- **Location:** `crates/datacraft-storage/src/jet/tdef.rs` (JetType::from_byte), `tests/oracle.rs` (skip path)
- **Problem:** Jet4 column type `0x11` is not in HACKING's (incomplete) type table and not in `docs/FORMAT-JET.md`; both fixtures use it in `MSysAccessObjects.Data` (long-value column). mdb-tools itself warns "unsupported data type 17" on the same column. Our reader answers with a precise `Unsupported`, and the oracle skips such tables.
- **Scope:** Focused study on the fixture's MSysAccessObjects rows (likely long-binary/LVAL like OLE; jackcess reads the table fine). Then either map the type or keep the precise `Unsupported` with a documented reason.
- **Acceptance:** Decision documented in `docs/FORMAT-JET.md`; oracle no longer needs the skip, or the skip carries the documented reason.

## 🔵 TEST GAPS

> No open items.

### [ ] T3 — Fixture pin integrity — restore pristine testV2000, keep Access-touched variant, manifest + CI hash gate — 🔵
- **Location:** `fixtures/` (`testV2000.mdb`, manifest), CI workflow
- **Problem:** `fixtures/testV2000.mdb` no longer matches the jackcess pin (`be0a2139`): the file was opened in real Access, which rewrote system-table pages and appended 22 pages on open (full evidence + hashes in `docs/FIXTURE-SOURCES.md` §4). A silently drifted fixture poisons the oracle evidence base — the recorded pin hash no longer describes the file on disk.
- **Scope:** restore pristine `testV2000.mdb` from the verified pin source (sha256 `126bad49…`); keep the Access-rewritten file as `fixtures/testV2000-access-touched.mdb` (second writer variant — T2 material, do not discard); replace `jackcess-pin.txt` with a per-file manifest (`repo@commit` + sha256, sources and recommended Phase-2 pin set per `docs/FIXTURE-SOURCES.md` §5); add a CI job that verifies committed fixture hashes; document the rule: fixtures are never opened in writer-capable applications (Access) — byte experiments run on copies only.
- **Acceptance:** committed `fixtures/manifest` hashes match the committed files and CI fails on drift; pristine + Access-touched variants exist as separate fixtures; pin set per docs/FIXTURE-SOURCES.md §5 pinned; rule documented in docs/TESTING.md.
