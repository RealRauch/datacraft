## 🔴 CRITICAL

> No open items.

### [ ] K1 — Initialize git repository with GitHub Actions quality gates — 🔴
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.gitignore`, repo root
- **Scope:** Git repository on `main`; CI jobs: rustfmt, clippy (deny warnings), cross-platform test matrix (Linux/macOS/Windows), coverage gate (`cargo-llvm-cov --fail-under-lines 95`), file-size gate (all `.rs` files < 500 lines). Cargo-dependent jobs guarded by `hashFiles('Cargo.toml')` until the workspace exists.
- **Acceptance:** Workflow file committed; file-size gate runs on every push; all five quality gates documented in the README.

### [ ] K2 — Author architecture blueprint (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — 🔴
- **Location:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Scope:** Clean-room principles; core/shell split (headless command API vs. thin egui projection); `StorageEngine` trait boundary with a pure-Rust Jet/ACE backend and libmdb strictly as CI test oracle (decision 2026-10-31); MCP/JSON-RPC readiness; deterministic test-ID scheme; module layout honoring the 500-line limit.
- **Acceptance:** All five project principles mapped to concrete mechanisms; decision record for the storage layer included.

## 🟠 HIGH

> No open items.

### [ ] H1 — Create Cargo workspace and dependency manifest — 🟠
- **Location:** `Cargo.toml` (workspace), member crates `datacraft-core`, `datacraft-storage`, `datacraft-ui`
- **Scope:** Workspace layout with lints inheritance; deps: `eframe`/`egui` (UI), `serde`/`serde_json`, `proptest` (dev); FFI limited to the test oracle (libmdb, dev/CI only); committed `Cargo.lock` (application).
- **Acceptance:** `cargo check` and `cargo test` pass on all three platforms; module skeleton below the 500-line limit.

### [ ] H2 — Coverage tooling and exception policy (docs/TESTING.md) — 🟠
- **Location:** `docs/TESTING.md`, CI coverage job
- **Scope:** `cargo-llvm-cov` configuration; documented `#[coverage(off)]` exception registry (only `main` and trivial egui glue, each with justification); test strategy: colocated unit tests, table-driven parser tests, proptest round-trips, golden-file tests.
- **Acceptance:** Coverage job green at >= 95% lines; every exception listed with justification.

### [ ] H3 — Toolchain pinning and lint configuration — 🟠
- **Location:** `rust-toolchain.toml`, `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.lints]`)
- **Scope:** MSRV pin, clippy lint groups with deny-warnings in CI, rustfmt defaults; shared workspace lints inherited by all member crates.
- **Acceptance:** Fresh clone builds warning-free on Linux, macOS and Windows.

### [ ] H4 — Define StorageEngine trait boundary — 🟠
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/src/engine.rs`
- **Scope:** Backend-agnostic traits (open, schema introspection, row reads, writes, transactions), error taxonomy, feature-gated backends: `jet-rs` (product) and `libmdb-oracle` (test-only, behind cfg(test)/feature flag).
- **Acceptance:** Trait and mock backend fully unit-tested; no Jet/ACE-specific types leak across the boundary.

### [ ] H5 — Pure-Rust Jet page layer and file header decoder — 🟠
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/src/jet/` (page layer, file header)
- **Scope:** Clean-room decoder for the Jet page layer based on public format documentation only (MDB Tools community docs, Microsoft Open Specifications): page headers, page allocation (usage maps), file header, version detection.
- **Acceptance:** Table-driven and proptest unit tests; byte-level parsing verified against fixture files; no code copied from MDB Tools.

### [ ] H6 — Pure-Rust table definition and data decoder — 🟠
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/src/jet/` (TDEF/TDAT decoders)
- **Scope:** Table definition pages (TDEF), column metadata (V2/V3 descriptors), data pages (TDAT), data types (text/memo/number/date/currency/boolean/OLE), system table (`MSysObjects`) introspection.
- **Acceptance:** Fixtures readable table-by-table with deterministic ordering; unit tests colocated; coverage gate green.

### [ ] H7 — libmdb test oracle integration and golden-file suite — 🟠
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/tests/`, `fixtures/`, CI oracle job
- **Scope:** Reference databases created with MDB Tools tooling only; libmdb invoked in CI/tests as read-only oracle; strict schema + row comparison between our decoder and libmdb output; golden-file round-trip harness for the later write path.
- **Acceptance:** Oracle comparison green in CI on all three platforms; mismatches fail with byte-level diagnostics.
