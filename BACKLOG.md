- K1 — Initialize git repository with GitHub Actions quality gates — done (done in `db6e6d5` — workflow with fmt/clippy/test-matrix/coverage/file-size jobs; cargo jobs guarded until workspace; amended in 6e2a3df (foreign .tmp-brand files unstaged))
- K2 — Author architecture blueprint (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — done (done in `f28165d` — docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: principles→mechanisms, crate graph, command API, storage decision record, phase mapping)
- H1 — Create Cargo workspace and dependency manifest — done (done in `68aab5f` + `930a289` — workspace with core/storage/ui crates, edition 2024, deps via cargo add (eframe 0.37.0), committed Cargo.lock)
- H2 — Coverage tooling and exception policy (docs/TESTING.md) — done (done in `16e6c4d` — docs/TESTING.md with exception registry #1 (datacraft-ui crate exclusion; coverage attribute unstable on stable), ci.yml coverage job updated)
- H3 — Toolchain pinning and lint configuration — done (done in `6e2a3df` — rust-toolchain.toml pinned to 1.98.1, MSRV 1.98 in workspace.package, shared lints (unsafe_code forbid, clippy all))
- K3 — Repair invalid CI workflow (hashFiles in job-level if) — done (done in the `fix(ci)` commit — preflight job pattern replaces invalid hashFiles-in-job-if; first valid run 41242950916 in progress)
- T1 — Boundary coverage below gate — error display arms and mock write-path validations untested — done (done in `2084be0` — contract+colocated tests close gap; coverage 81.92% -> 98.17%; found by CI gate (run 41242950916), lesson: canonical verification set runs per step)
- M1 — Decide persistence format of the form/report design layer — done (decided 2026-10-31 via ADR-1 in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §7 (human offline, default ratified by blanket phase 3-9 release): versioned .datacraft sidecar (serde JSON) for phases 5-8; native accdb embedding only after ACE writer)
- T2 — Real-row tail semantics — mask bytes and var_table entries disagree with synthetic model — done (commit: null-mask bit index = column id (row.rs); oracle green on both fixture writers; CI oracle job added)

- H7 — libmdb test oracle integration and golden-file suite — done (steps 2.4 + T2 fixes (a200dee, 92bce57, 683a88f); CI oracle job added; T3 keeps fixture-pin follow-up open)

- H12 — GUID field kind — plain Replication ID columns unmodelable — done (decided: dedicated FieldKind::Guid; implemented with H16 (tests f4c96d3/e1bb1bb, adapter 67a3b64); decision documented in docs/FORMAT-JET.md "Domain mapping")
- H16 — StoragePort adapter — Jet4 backend implements the core port — done (step within Phase 5 (tests 96bc864/aacc8ab, feat 67a3b64); includes the multi-page TDEF decoder extension; seam tests on both sides per LESSONS #2)

- F1 — Ribbon spec/mapping seam was unguarded — Create tab panic — done (fixed immediately: total command_for mapping + seam test in ui crate (next commit); no unreachable! left in paint code)
- H9 — Jet4 writer workstream (create tables, write rows) — done (Phase 10, steps 10.1-10.3 (checkpoint 73f540b): writer core + create/insert + round-trip acceptance; Access-repair gate documented as manual follow-up)
- H31 — Report canvas — print layout and preview — done (Phase 10, steps 10.4-10.5 (checkpoint 1440c64): print-geometry designer + preview runtime; grouped/aggregate bands deferred to M1)
