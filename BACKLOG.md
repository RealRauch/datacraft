## 🔴 CRITICAL

> No open items.

---

## 🟠 HIGH

> No open items.

### [ ] H4 — Define StorageEngine trait boundary — 🟠
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/src/engine.rs`
- **Scope:** Backend-agnostic traits (open, schema introspection, row reads, writes, transactions), error taxonomy, feature-gated backends: `jet-rs` (product) and `libmdb-oracle` (test-only, behind cfg(test)/feature flag).
- **Acceptance:** Trait and mock backend fully unit-tested; no Jet/ACE-specific types leak across the boundary.

### [ ] H5 — Pure-Rust Jet page layer and file header decoder — 🟠
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/src/jet/` (page layer, file header)
- **Scope:** Clean-room decoder for the Jet page layer based on public format documentation only (MDB Tools community docs, Microsoft Open Specifications): page headers, page allocation (usage maps), file header, version detection.
- **Acceptance:** Table-driven and proptest unit tests; byte-level parsing verified against fixture files; no code copied from MDB Tools.

### [ ] H6 — Pure-Rust table definition and data decoder — 🟠
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/src/jet/` (TDEF/TDAT decoders)
- **Scope:** Table definition pages (TDEF), column metadata (V2/V3 descriptors), data pages (TDAT), data types (text/memo/number/date/currency/boolean/OLE), system table (`MSysObjects`) introspection.
- **Acceptance:** Fixtures readable table-by-table with deterministic ordering; unit tests colocated; coverage gate green.

### [ ] H7 — libmdb test oracle integration and golden-file suite — 🟠
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/tests/`, `fixtures/`, CI oracle job
- **Scope (revised 2026-10-31, human decisions):** libmdb oracle runs **in CI only** — ubuntu (apt `mdbtools`) and macOS (brew), no local Windows oracle. Oracle compares our decoder against **real `.mdb` sample databases pinned from a public source** (test data, not code — MDB Tools cannot create databases); local Windows verification relies on synthetic fixtures built by our own test helpers. Strict schema + row comparison; golden-file round-trip harness for the later write path. Encrypted/password-protected databases are detected and rejected with `Unsupported` (no decryption). The CI system-deps step is High-class (within released H7 scope, flagged at the step).
- **Acceptance:** Oracle comparison green in CI on ubuntu + macOS against pinned real fixtures; mismatches fail with byte-level diagnostics; local suite passes with synthetic fixtures only.

### [ ] H8 — CLI client as fourth headless command-bus client — 🟠
- **Location:** new crate `crates/datacraft-cli` (bin `datacraft-cli`), step 9.4
- **Scope:** Fourth client of the command bus (besides GUI, MCP/JSON-RPC server, test harness): args → `Command` variants → `dispatch()` → human-readable or `--json` output of events and `inspect()` snapshots. No logic — transport only; shares the transport layer with the Phase 9.1 MCP server. Exit codes meaningful and deterministic output for headless tests.
- **Acceptance:** Every command-bus operation reachable from the shell; round-trip tests assert JSON snapshots; crate rules respected (ui/cli never touch storage directly).

### [ ] H9 — Jet4 writer workstream (create tables, write rows) — 🟠
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/src/jet/` (writer), post-Phase-4 workstream
- **Scope:** Jet4 write milestone from ARCHITECTURE §6 (create tables, insert/update rows, usage-map allocation, index maintenance deferred). UI write commands route to `InMemoryEngine` until this lands; then the `Jet4Backend` gains write capability. Bit-for-bit goal: writes must open without repair prompts in MS Access — proven by golden round-trips + oracle.
- **Acceptance:** Access opens written files without repair; decode(encode(decode(x))) == decode(x) over fixtures; write-path coverage >= gate.

## 🟡 MEDIUM

> No open items.

## 🟢 LOW

> No open items.

### [ ] L1 — Jet 3 (Access 97) read support — 🟢
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/src/jet/`
- **Scope:** Jet 3 (Access 97) read support: 2048-byte pages, codepage-based text (no UTF-16), Jet3 TDEF layout. Deferred per default decision 2026-10-31 — Jet4 and ACE read paths come first; Jet3 files are detected via the version dword and rejected with a precise `Unsupported` error until this item lands.
- **Acceptance:** A Jet3 fixture decodes to schema + rows through the same `StorageEngine` boundary.

## 🔵 TEST GAPS

> No open items.

### [ ] T2 — Real-row tail semantics — mask bytes and var_table entries disagree with synthetic model — 🔵
- **Location:** `datacraft-storage/src/jet/row.rs` (RowLayout), real fixture `fixtures/testV2000.mdb`
- **Goal:** Resolve the real-row tail semantics: on the real Access 2000 fixture the catalog rows decode (num_cols=17, var_len=11, plausible fixed values) but the null mask reads `[ff 00 00]` where descriptor-order semantics expect `[5c 28 01]`, and var_table entries read 50/52 while eod=46 — the real tail field order (var_table/eod/var_len/mask) and/or mask bit semantics differ from the synthetic model.
- **Scope:** Focused hex study of one known-content row + CI oracle cross-check (mdb-export) per docs/FORMAT-JET.md "Open: real-row tail semantics"; then fix RowLayout, keep synthetic fixtures byte-exact with reality, re-run the oracle comparison to green.
- **Acceptance:** `DATACRAFT_ORACLE_MDB` oracle test lists tables and matches mdb-export row counts/columns; all gates green; catalog names resolve for the fixture.
